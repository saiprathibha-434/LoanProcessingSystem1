//  <p>INTRODUCTION:
//  This document outlines the Project. The project is to develop LOAN APPLICATION PROCESSING System (LAPS). This document contains the work flow of the system and gives guidelines on how to build the functionality gradually in each of the course modules.
//  1.1 Setup Checklist for Project
//  Minimum System Requirements
//  ▪	Intel Pentium 90 or higher (P166 recommended)
//  ▪	Microsoft Windows 95, 98, or NT 4.0, 2k, XP, Windows 7
//  ▪	Memory: 32MB of RAM (64MB or more recommended)
//  ▪	Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher
//  1.2 Instructions
//  	The code modules in the mini project should follow all the coding standards.
//  	You can refer to your course material
//  	The total time required to complete this project is 50 hrs.
//  	Since this project work will span over couple of months, you will need to take care of maintaining the code
//  2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
//  Given that the changes that have taken place in the world, we found that paperwork is inconvenient way to record data. Most loan providers still use the old fashion, where they record all the details on the papers. No online service.
//  When a customer wants to know the remaining amount, he needs to go to in person or contact the provider. Then, the provider representative has to review the customer details manually and calculate the remaining amount. Unfortunately, this method is a waste of time, inaccurate and inefficient. The loan receiver sometimes could argue about missing data, such as an instalment that is missing and is not being recorded.
//  Here comes the idea of the project.
//  2.1 Objective
//  2.1.1 General Objective
//  To automate the process of Loan Processing System & Management & hence minimize errors resulting from manual system operations
//  2.1.2 Special Objective
//  The objective of this study is to develop distinguished institutions and organize loan management.
 
//  There are many goals and focus:                                                                                                                                                 
//  1- Saving time and effort 
//  2- Eliminate the use of paperwork for transactions 
//  3- Customer's vision towards the organization
//  4- And full customer access
//  2.1.3 Scope of the Study
//  There are several loan management systems, from the traditional methods of paper and pen to electronic record keeping. However, a few of these systems are interoperable and all records are considered the property of the enterprise without the client. 
//  The system (LMS) will help improve communication and flexibility between the parties and the full knowledge of both parties
//  2.2 Abstract of the Project
//  A business objective of providing efficient loan process using technology as an enabler in order to give the company a competitive advantage within the industry suggests automation. Although a number of lenders have a certain kind of technology infused into their loan processing system, there are noticeable insufficiencies. Finding a guide to the design and creation of a loan automation system is also elusive. There is therefore the need for the creation of a loan automation application which this research addressed. Design and creation research strategy was adopted and data collection was through existing documents and structured interviews. Waterfall software development method was adopted. The outcome provides a loan automation application that saves paper works throughout the life of the loan, and its design is also available as a contributory guide towards creation of similar system. 
 
//  3. IMPLEMENTATION
//  3.1 System Design Objectives
//  The propose system is web based software having features and further detailed as follows:
//   i. Home page, News page, Service Page, About Us page and the Contact Us page. 
//  ii. Fast internet connection speed 
//  iii. Login page where clients will log in and make loan, pay loan, change of password and also see messages from the administrators. 
//   iv. Allows administrators to easily authorize users to manipulate certain pages on their web pages as checking their account balance. 
//  v. Service page which contains all information on the loan types, categories and payment plans, among others 
//  vi. On the administrator’s page the Admin will approve each client loan status after the request of loan has been sent by each client.
